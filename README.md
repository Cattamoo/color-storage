# Color Storage ðŸŽ¨

I made this project because I felt uncomfortable while organizing the color in Notion.

## How to use this app

The focus is on modifying it to make it easier to use from the existing method.
If you select a color, I made it to have a color chip, text color, and background color of that color.
So the way you use this app is by selecting the color. There's only one thing.

## Before I made this app

I used Notion like this picture:

It's a process to make it like that.
1. Select a color.
2. Enter the color name in Notion.
3. (Not shown in the picture) Write a formula that displays text colors and background colors.
4. Make a color chip of that color using Photoshop.
5. Register with Notion.

Through this complicated process, I was able to make colors.
